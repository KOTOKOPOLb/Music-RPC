# Music Discord Rich Presence

This application is designed to display the music you are currently listening to on your computer in your Discord status, using Rich Presence.

![image](https://github.com/KOTOKOPOLb/Music-RPC/raw/main/imgages/screen.png)

There are many similar RPCs that display the current music playing, but they may have various issues. That's why I created a code that retrieves information from the `Windows.Media.Control`, and displays it in your Discord status.

The image for this track is searched through the [Yandex Music](https://music.yandex.ru/) service. Therefore, the image may occasionally not be displayed.

## How to Use

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/KOTOKOPOLb/Music-RPC/releases)

2. Unzip the files

3. Run **Music RPC.exe**
